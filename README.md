<b><h2>Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset</h2></b>

<b>Project Overview</b> 

This repository contains a comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) project using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal of this project is to perform thorough data cleaning and analyze the dataset to uncover relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends.

<b>Dataset</b>

The dataset used for this analysis is the Titanic dataset, which includes information about passengers aboard the Titanic, such as age, sex, ticket class, and survival status. This dataset is publicly available on Kaggle and is commonly used for data analysis and machine learning tasks.

<b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</b>

The EDA involves exploring the relationships between different variables and identifying patterns and trends. Key analyses include:

- Analyzing the distribution of survival rates based on different features such as age, sex, and ticket class.
- Visualizing correlations between variables.
- Identifying any significant patterns or anomalies in the dataset.

<b>Results</b>

The analysis reveals various insights into the Titanic dataset, including:

- Trends and patterns in survival rates across different passenger demographics.
- Key factors influencing survival chances.
